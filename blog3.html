        <h2 class="section-heading">The Night I Felt Lost</h2>
        <p>The stars were out, but they offered no guidance. It was one of those nights where the world felt too big, and I felt impossibly small, adrift in a sea of my thoughts. The air was cool, heavy with the scent of earth, and the streets were eerily quiet except for the occasional sound of cars passing by. I wandered, my sneakers scuffing against the road, each step a question I couldn’t answer.</p>
        <p>I don’t know exactly when the feeling started. Maybe it was earlier that day when a conversation with a friend left me questioning my choices. Or maybe it was the weight of a decision I’d been avoiding, pressing harder against my chest. But by nightfall, it was undeniable: I was lost. My purpose, my direction, my sense of self—they all felt like shadows slipping through my fingers.</p>
        <div class="favorite-quote-card reveal">
          <p>Being lost is not the end; it’s the beginning of finding a new path.</p>
          <cite>— Unknown</cite>
        </div>
        <p>I passed by the street park and found a bench near an oak tree that’s probably seen more heartbreaks than I’ll ever know. I wondered if anyone else had ever felt this way, like they were standing at a crossroads with no signs to guide them. I thought about calling someone, but what would I say? “I’m lost, but I don’t know why”? It sounded ridiculous even in my head.</p>
        <p>It felt like I was questioning every choice I’d made so far, every decision that brought me here. Saying “I have no regrets” would be a lie, but I’ve always tried to take responsibility for the paths I chose, whether they brought comfort or chaos. Moving to the USA was one of the biggest decisions of my life. At first, I believed it was just a new beginning for the same version of me. But I was wrong—it wasn’t a continuation, it was a complete restart. Everything I thought I knew, everything I’d learned, didn’t quite fit anymore. I had to unlearn and start over, learning the new place, the new culture, the silences between conversations.</p>
        <div class="highlight-quote">I didn’t cross oceans and burn bridges behind me just to turn around. I may be lost right now, but I know I’m not broken.</div>
        <p>Some nights, it all plays out in front of me in 4K—vivid, loud, and unskippable. And in those moments, I can’t help but wonder if I made a mistake. Leaving my job, my home, my friends, chasing a dream that now feels distant in a place that’s familiar on paper but foreign in spirit. Yet even in the uncertainty, there’s a strange kind of peace settling in. Like the storm isn’t over, but I’ve found a way to breathe inside it. Some part of me still believes there’s hope here, that this chaos is carving out something better, even if I can’t see it yet. I think I can feel it.</p>
        <p>I sat there, letting the silence answer the questions I was too tired to ask. The bench felt cold beneath me, grounding in a way I hadn’t expected. I pulled out my AirPods and tuned into my “Nights” playlist. My thoughts still raced, sure, but I stopped trying to chase them. I just told myself, “Let them run.” Somewhere between the streetlight’s flicker and the distant hum of a car engine, I realized I wasn’t looking for answers anymore.</p>
        <p>As I stood up to leave, I looked at that old oak tree one more time. It didn’t say anything, but something about its stillness made me feel less alone.</p>
